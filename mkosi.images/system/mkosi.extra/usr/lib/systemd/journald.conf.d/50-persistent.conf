# We only ship /usr in the image so /var/log/journal won't exist on boot which means systemd-journald won't
# persist any logs as the default Storage= setting is "auto". We can't create /var/log/journal using tmpfiles
# as systemd-journal-flush.service runs before systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service so instead we explicitly set
# Storage= to persistent to have systemd-journald create /var/log/journal itself.
