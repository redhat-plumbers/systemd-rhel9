# Description
#
# Each node on IEEE 1394 bus has configuration ROM with information for identification. Although the
# typical content of configuration ROM is defined by 1394 Trading Association, many nodes have own
# quirks. This database includes supplemental information to unit in the node.

# Convention
#
# One entry has two keys. One is customized key to match a node. Another is for kernel alias to
# match an unit included in the node.
#
# The customized key has two formats according to whether the node has model attribute:
#  - ven0x000000mo0x000000units0x000000:0x000000
#  - ven0x000000units0x000000:0x000000
#
# Even when the node has multiple units, the entry should match to one of the units. In the case,
# the customized key should have wild pattern for units field:
#  - ven0x000000mo0x000000units*0x000000:0x000000*
#  - ven0x000000units*0x000000:0x000000*
#
# The hexadecimal digits part of the customized key should be lower-case. Linux FireWire subsystem
# uses lower-case value for attributes of sysfs node, and systemd-hwdb parses the custom key by
# case-sensitive way. On the other hand, it parses kernel alias by case-insensitive way.
#
# The entry should have some of IEEE1394_UNIT_FUNCTION_XXX environment variables to express function
# of the unit. The variables are used to decide group owner of special file for character device
# corresponding to node including the unit. At present, below variables are supported:
#  - IEEE1394_UNIT_FUNCTION_MIDI
#    - For any unit to process MIDI messages. For example, the unit includes AV/C music subunit.
#  - IEEE1394_UNIT_FUNCTION_AUDIO
#    - For any unit to process audio signal. For example, the unit includes AV/C audio subunit.
#  - IEEE1394_UNIT_FUNCTION_VIDEO
#    - For any unit to process video signal.
#
# Additionally, ID_VENDOR_FROM_DATABASE and ID_MODEL_FROM_DATABASE environment variables are
# preferable.
